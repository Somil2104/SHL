Assessment Fact Sheet
Overview
Knowledge, Skills, Abilities and Competencies MeasuredDetailsThe DSI is a short pre-screening tool for many key entry-level roles. It is designed to 
identify potential employees who will have good dependability and reliability, and who are 
less likely to engage in counter-productive work behaviours. It is a complementary tool to 
other assessments, such as ability tests and structured interviews.
Job Family/Title  ..................................................................... Entry Level
The DSI identifies people who are more likely to have good attendance records, be effective 
and positive team members, and have fewer accidents. Each candidate is given a score that 
indicates whether he or she is likely to be a safe, reliable and productive employee.
The DSI helps you:
• Reduce accidents at work
• Boost productivity and customer satisfaction through more dependable staff
• Reduce days lost due to absenteeism
Unwarranted absenteeism is not only costly in terms of lost productivity, it also impacts 
customer satisfaction. Work-related accidents can also lead to prolonged absence, and 
the costs of litigation. We have worked with clients across a wide range of industries to 
identify low-risk, highly dependable employees for a wide range of positions, from front-
line customer service to operational roles.Average Testing Time  ......................................................... 5-7 minutes

Motivation  Questionnaire  
Assessment  Fact Sheet  
Overview  The Motivation  Questionnaire (MQ) assesses what situations are likely to increase or reduce an 
individual’s motivation at work. It provides a comprehensive profile of the motivational factors  that affect 
an individual’s performance and their drive to succeed. By understanding what motivates an individual, 
it is possible to unlock each individual’s full potential and direct their energies more constructively. The 
information  the MQ provides can help in maximizing  the motivation and energy individuals bring to their 
jobs and thereby can have  a significant impact on the achievement of their key deliverables.  
The MQ  has been redesigned  with a new look and feel , providing an enhanced mobile -first candidate 
experience.

Measured  The 18 dimensions of motivation measured by the assessment are divided into four broad areas:  
• Energy & Dynamism : the main sources of energy and drive for the individual at work (e.g. 
Competition, Power)  
• Synergy : the aspects of organizational culture that are important to the individual (e.g. 
Recognition, Personal Principles)  
• Intrinsic : the features of tasks that the individual may find satisfying (e.g. Interest, Flexibility)  
• Extrinsic : the external motivators present in a work environment (e.g. Material Reward)  
Several  reports are available for trained and  untrained users:  
The Profile Chart : Maps the individual’s motivational drivers against a selected benchmark, and 
indicates  key motivators and demotivators. Designed for use by trained users.  
The Employee Motivation Report : Ideal for use by line managers and those concerned with 
employees’ performance and well -being, this report provides an in -depth and easy -to-understand 
evaluation of what motivates and demotivates an individual. It also offers a comprehensive list of tips 
and suggestions for managing the  employee’s strongest motivators and demotivators.  
The Candidate Motivation Report : This report allows individuals completing the questionnaire to 
understand what drives their motivation and can encourage them to take greater ownership of their 
developmen t plans.  
The Motivation Pack : The MQ Report pack consists of the Profile Chart, Employee Motivation Report 
and the Candidate Report and is a cost -effective way of ensuring that your organization takes a 
comprehensive approach to understanding what motivate s its employees.

Measured  
 The Manager Plus Report shows how an individual : 
 Prefers to work ( e.g. whether they like to sell and negotiate, or not ). This information covers 
three key areas: how an individual interacts with people; how they approach tasks; and how 
their feelings and emotions impact at work.  
 Is likely to perform against the 20 Universal C ompetencies proven to be important at  work  
(e.g. Leading & Supervising ) 
 Is likely to interact with colleagues and the impact the individual will have on a team  
 
There is growing recognition that successful teams contribute greatly to an  organisation’s success, 
however, few tools in the market offer a prac tical and cost  effective  way of measuring, building and 
selecting teams. The Manager Plus Report  incorporates SHL’s Team Impact model which 
addresses these issues  and provides users with an easy to use and relevant way of evaluating and 
monitoring  team dyn amics."

OPQ MQ Sales Report  
Report  Fact Sheet  
Overview  The Sales Report provides a snapshot of an individual’s natural styles that are critical to sales 
success in a simple, easy -to-use format.  
Each of the three sections in the report provides a graphical scale showing how the candidate’s 
responses rated on a  scale of low to high, or not motivating to very motivating. Each rating is 
followed by a description of how a high or a low score could be interpreted for on -the-job 
performance, enabling a hiring manager to identify potential strengths, weaknesses and ar eas to 
investigate further . 
Job Family/Title  Sales  
Applications 
and Benefits  Identify, hire and develop top -performing sales  professionals, whatever the sales environment . The 
Sales Report is a valuable online tool that makes recruiting or developing sales people easier and 
more cost -effective.  
The Sales Report helps to : 
 Identify top sales performers  
 Recruit sales people with the potential to sell more  
 Reduce the costs of turnover in sales teams  
 Develop existing sales teams  
Knowledge, 
Skills, Abilitie s 
and 
Competencies 
Measured  
 The Sales Report is based on the OPQ32 and, optionally, the Motivation Questionnaire. Combined, 
these tools offer a precise and in -depth picture of the important factors relevant for success in sales.  
It measures success factors in three main areas:  
 Sales Foundations: Factors important to sales effectiveness in most sales situations  
 Sales Cycle: How an individual is likely to perform in specific sales situations  
 Motivation: Aspects of motivation critical to keeping sales p eople performing at their peak  
 
There are also additional tools available that support the use of the Sales Report. These are 
available in a more limited number of languages than the report. These tools include SHL Sales 
Model Profiler cards  and the Sales Report Interview Guide.  
The Sales Model Profiler cards have been developed to enable clients to use the Sales  Report more 
effectively, by helping clients to understand which competencies and  motivators described in the 
report are most important to a speci fic sales role.   
The Sales Report Interview Guide provides a structured way of gathering information  about each 
candidate and their competency potential in relation to a sales role. It is  based on the 22 
competencies and motivators in the SHL Sales Model and can be  used to identify relevant areas to 
probe during an interview."

Measured  Numerical Ability : The Numerical Ability questions are designed to measure the ability to solve 
problems involving numerical data by using the proper mathematical methods  and the ability to interpret 
data presented in charts, graphs, and tables. Candidates will be asked to make correct decisions or 
inferences from numerical or statistical data. This ability is commonly required to support work and 
decision -making in many d ifferent types of jobs at many levels.  
Deductive Reasoning : These questions are designed to assess the candidate’s ability to draw logical 
conclusions based on information provided, identify strengths and weaknesses of arguments, and 
complete scenarios using incomplete information. It provides an indication of how an individual will 
perform when asked to develop solutions when presented with information and draw sound conclusions 
from data.  
Inductive Reasoning : Ten questions are completely non -verbal and  feature only shapes and figures. 
These questions are designed to measure the ability to detect regularities, patterns, and generalizations 
and infer rules that can be applied to different situations . Individuals high in this ability tend to excel in 
globa l and strategic thinking and are good at finding errors in work processes.

Numerical 
Ability Sample 
Question   
A car dealership lowered all of its car prices by 15%.  
Given the above information, what was the original price of a car now priced at £9500?  
A. £8075.00  
B. £10,925.00  
C. £11,000.00  
D. £11,176.47  
E. £12,322.13  
To answer the question, the candidate must calculate the full price of the car before the 15% discount. 
The price £9500 is 85% of the full price (100% -15%). So, the calculation is the  cost of the car post -
discount divided by 85 (to find 1% of the full price), then multiplied by 100 to obtain the full cost pre -
discount. So the answer is D: £11,176.47

Reasoning 
Sample 
Question   
Review the facts below.  
 
 Jane drives a red car.  
 Susan drives a blue car.

1. Jane lives in Ohio.  
2. Susan lives in Ohio.  
3. Red cars get 36 miles per gallon of gasoline.  
4. Susan’s car gets 33 miles per gallon of gasoline.  
5. Jane and Susan live in the same state.  
 
The correct answer is D. Since blue cars get 33 miles per gallon of gas, the fact that Susan drives a blue 
car means that her car gets 33 miles per gallon o f gas.

Example 
Question s A car  dealership  lowered  all of its car prices  by 15%.  
Given  the above  information,  what  was the original  price  of a car now priced  at £9500?  
A. £8075.00  
B. £10,925.00  
C. £11,000.00  
D. £11,176.47  
E. £12,322.13  
 
To answer  the question,  the candidate  must  calculate  the full price  of the car before  the 15% discount.  
The price  £9500  is 85% of the full price  (100% -15%).  So, the calculation  is the cost of the car post- 
discount  divided  by 85 (to find 1% of the full price),  then multiplied  by 100 to obtain  the full cost pre- 
discount.  So the answer  is D: £11,176.47"

be then? The big problems will be housing and services. Will there be enough housing? Will services be 
adequate? 
The good news is that the city appears to be moving in the right direction. Not only does it have a 
number of well-established programs in place, but it has encouraged the formation of new programs as 
well.

 In a 360º feedback review individuals receive structured feedback – measured against the needs of the 
business – from managers, direct reports, peers, colleagues and customers. Having a more objective 
and broader perspective on performance helps place people where they will be most effective. 360° 
feedback can also be used to identify what will be needed of individuals in future, helping plan their 
development and next career move."
